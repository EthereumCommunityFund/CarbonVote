What is Carbonvote [TL;DR]
-----------------------------------

The name “Carbonvote” is composed of two elements: “Carbon” and “vote”. In this context, “Carbon” symbolizes something fundamental and elemental. Just like Carbonvote is a fundamental governance tool in the Ethereum community it provides the functionality of poll voting and counting for big community decisions.

How does Carbonvote work?
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

| Carbonvote is utilizing Ether addresses and the Ether (ETH) balances as weights for voting. The key feature of this system is that it determines the weight of each address in a vote by taking a snapshot of the ETH balances of the Ether addresses participating in the vote at a specific time. This means that a user’s ETH balance is recorded at some point before the vote begins, but the user does not need to transfer ETH from their address to vote.
| In Carbonvote, the user’s Ether address acts as an authentication tool for identity, while the user’s ETH balance on the cutoff date serves as the basis for their voting weight. This mechanism allows users to participate in voting directly through their Ether account without any complex transactions or contractual maneuvers. both Yes and No options have an address, and users express their willingness to vote in a simple way, which is by sending a tiny amount of ETH to a specific address.
| The transparency of the voting process is made possible by the public and immutable nature of the Ethernet blockchain, where each voting action is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring that the process is verifiable. While this method is technically relatively simple, it utilizes blockchain technology to enable community voting.

History of Carbonvote
-------------------------

The appearance of Carbonvote and its first use 
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In 2016, following the DAO hack on the Ethereum blockchain, the Ethereum community faced a critical decision regarding whether to implement a hard fork to reverse the theft. This scenario led to the emergence of Carbonvote, a real-time voting mechanism that allowed Ethereum token holders to express their opinions on this pivotal issue. The result of the Carbonvote significantly influenced the course of the Ethereum blockchain, leading to its split into Ethereum (ETH) and Ethereum Classic (ETC). [TL;DR]

| Carbonvote was first used in the Ether community in 2016, a moment closely associated with an important event in the history of the Ether network. At the heart of this event was the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization), an Ether-based smart contract system designed to serve as a decentralized venture capital platform. However, in June 2016, a large amount of Ether was illegally transferred due to the exploitation of a security vulnerability, which became one of the major and controversial events in Ether. To address this issue, the community came up with a fork proposal that aimed to recover the funds stolen due to the DAO vulnerability by modifying Ether's code. This proposal sparked a heated debate within the community, with some arguing that the fork was necessary to correct the theft and protect the interests of investors on the one hand, and others arguing that the fork violated the core principle of blockchain immutability on the other.  
| Against this backdrop, Carbonvote is being used as a tool to gauge community support for the proposed hard fork. Users can express their support or opposition by sending a tiny amount of ETH to a specific address, and the amount of ETH in each address is used to measure the voting weight at a specific point in time. The results of the poll showed a significant portion of the community in favor of a hard fork, which ultimately led to the splitting of the Ether network into two separate chains: the Ether (ETH) and the Ether Classic (ETC).

The second use
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In 2017, Carbonvote was once again utilized in the Ethereum community, this time concerning the issue of reducing the block reward. The question at hand was whether the Ethereum network should reduce the block reward given to miners, a significant decision that would impact the network’s economic model and miner incentives. For the first time, Carbonvote has played an important role in the community decision-making process. As a result, the Ethereum block reward has been reduced to 1 ETH. [TL;DR]

| In 2017, the Ethereum community launched the Carbonvote system again, this time to address an important economic strategy regarding miners’ mining rewards. At the time, miners received a block reward of 5 ETH for mining a new block. This reward mechanism was a major source of incentive for miners, motivating them to keep the network secure and process transactions. However, as the Ethereum network grew, the community became concerned about the impact of the size of the block reward on the overall network economy. Excessive rewards could lead to inflation, which could negatively impact the value of Ether. This led to a key discussion about whether block rewards should be reduced to control inflation while maintaining sufficient incentives for miners. The decision facing the community was to reduce the block reward from 5 ETH to a lower value, such as 3 ETH or less.
| In this vote, the majority of community members chose to support lowering block rewards. Specifically, community members generally supported lowering the reward per block from 5 ETH to 3 ETH. In response to the results of this vote, Ether underwent a network upgrade, commonly referred to as the “Byzantium” upgrade, which is included in Ether’s ” Metropolis” phase. In this upgrade, the block reward was indeed reduced from 5 ETH to 3 ETH, a tweak that was seen as a way to balance the incentives of miners and control the growth of Ether’s supply, to find a balance between improving network security and controlling inflation.
